cloud concepts
----------------
the language of cloud computing
the economy of cloud computing 
cloud service models
azure marketplace
cloud architecture models
------------------------
cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources. split into three main categories
1.compute  2.networking  3.storage

Terms
--------------------------------------
1.High avalability ---> which is core to the cloud, including azure.it is also the cornerstone of the other cloud language items.

    Traditional                                  Cloud 
 ------------------                          -----------------
1.you own the hardware                      1.you don't own the hardware
2.you have physical access                  2.add more servers with a click
3.you can't 'just add servers'              3.if hardware fails, replace it instantly
                                            4.use clusters to ensure high availability

high availability is depends on number of virtual machines set up to essentially cover each other, incase one die.which is an identical grouping of virtual machines.



2.Reliability --->a.k.a Fault tolerance /disaster recovery
resilience --> the ability of a system to recover from failures and to continue to function.
. where high availability doesn't guarantee 0 downtime, a reliable system does.
.when something goes wrong that causes an azure service or resource to fail they can be mitigated by death with by azure itself, usually automatically.

Reliability can be achieved through a combination of 2 strategies
(a) Deploy resources in multiple locations 
	-global-scale computing
	-Protects against regional failure/disaster
(b) No single point of failure
	-Resources in multiple locations 
	-if one computer goes down, others pick up the load


3.Scalability ---> is the process of adding more resources on an as-needed basis.
scale out -adding more resources 
scale out -removing resources

.automatically adjust resources to meet demand
	example : increase number of vms to handle peak traffic
Horizontal scaling == adding additional VMs / containers [sometimes also known as scaling out]
Verical scaling == increasing power (eg. CPU/RAM) of existing VMs [some times also refers to scalling up]
