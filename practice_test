-> characteristics of consumption-based model:
         -no upfront costs
         -the ability to stop paying for resources that no longer useed
  
-> agility means that you can deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as app requirements chnage.

-> disaster recovery - What are cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution features

-> IaaS - customer responsible for managing Operating System.

-> PaaS - You need to focus on application development rather than configuration and management of servers.
            - Azure SQL data base - PaaS
            - microsoft 365 - SaaS
            - Azure Cosmos DB - PaaS
            - Azure Backup - PaaS
            - Azure file - IaaS
            - DNS server that runs on virtual machine - PaaS
            - Microsoft Intune - SaaS

-> Characteristics of ARM - Idempotency, Declarative, Source control

-> Resource group can contain resources from multiple regions

-> High availability - If one resource on Azure dies unexpectedly, another resource will almost instantly take over the workload

-> factors affecting azure costs
      - resource location
      - resource usage

-> OpEx is an ongoing cost for running a business. CapEx is the cost of acquiring and maintaining assets.

-> characteristics of private cloud deployment model
      -Hardware must be purchased
      -the company has the complete control over physical resources and security

-> common application types hosted on azre app services are - web apps -API apps - Web apps for containers

-> Fully Managed platform - Servers, network, storage, and more are all managed by Azure. You focus on your business value and logic.

-> High availability in a public cloud environment dependent on - SLA [ service level agreement]

-> Reliable - Ensuring services and applications remain available in the event of a failure

-> Predictability - Knowing that your application will always perform as expected regardless of user load

-> Elasticity - automatically scalling

-> Geo-Location allows you to deploy applications to regional datacenters around the world

-> Resource Tags - associating costs with different environments
              - categorizing costs by department

-> What can you use to restrict the deployment of a virtual machine to a specific location? - Azure Policy

-> Actions performed by azure portal - create new resources
                                     - create microsoft entra

-> Azure Resource Manager(ARM) - management layer accepts requests from any Azure tool or API and enables you to create, update, and delete resources in an Azure account
      -can you use to create resources in Azure and includes a validation step to ensure all resources are created in a specific order based on dependencies, in parallel and idempotent
ARM is the deployment and management service for Azure.

-> Azure Arc - simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform.

-> Azure Advisor - recommendations to reduce the cost of Azure resources

-> Apllication Insights - use to automatically detect performance anomalies for web apps

-> Azure Monitor is a platform for collecting, analyzing, visualizing, and alerting based on metrics. Azure Monitor can log data from an entire Azure and on-premises environment.

-> Data Policy - Which feature in the Microsoft Purview governance portal should you use to manage access to data sources and datasets

-> In a region pair, a region is paired with another region in the same - Geography

-> Subscription - Azure generate separate billing reports and invoices by default

-> VPN Gateway - connecting on-premises datacenter to an azure virtual network [mostly in hybrid cloud model]

-> Azure dedicated hosts run on their own dedicated hardware inside the Azure datacenter and only your chosen VMs will run on it.

-> Peering - You need to allow resources on two different Azure virtual networks to communicate with each other.

-> Azure blob storage ue cases - storing data for backups and restore
                               - serving images or documents directly to a browser

-> Hot - Highest storage cost and the fastest access time for reading

-> Scope - To which object or level is an Azure role-based access control (RBAC) role applied

-> Conditional Access - Microsoft Entra feature can you use to ensure that users can only access Microsoft Office 365 applications from approved client applications

-> Microsoft Entra Connect - u use to sync identities from an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain to Microsoft Entra

-> Distributed denial-of-service attack - An attack where lots of computers target a single server or website with the aim of making it stop

-> Microsoft Sentinel will collate, aggregate, and analyze data from multiple Azure services to detect any unusual behavior or patterns

-> Azure App Services - Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure.

-> Application Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for web developers on multiple platforms that you can use to monitor web applications. While this provides incredibly powerful insights, it isn't used to host the web app itself.

-> Conditional Access policies are a component of Azure AD to allow authentication based on conditions (i.e., if-then statements) that must be met to either allow or deny access.

-> The Service Trust Portal contains details about Microsoft's implementation of controls and processes that protect Microsoft's cloud services and the customers that use it.

-> Azure Data Lake makes it easy to store data of any size, shape, and speed, and do a variety of processing and analytics tasks across platforms and languages.

-> Access Control (IAM) can be used to prevent the creation of Azure resources, but improper use could prevent required system access from other administrators
